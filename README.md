# Waiting-for-the-Prince-Charming

Replication for Normann Rion's paper "Waiting for the Prince Charming: Fixed-Term Contracts as Stopgaps":
   - `calibration.jl` computes and stores the different calibrations used in the paper
   - `comparative_statics.jl` plots the comparative statics and post-reform transition graphs
   - `pol_uncertainty.jl` plots the paths of firing costs and employments in the model with uncertainty over firing costs
   - `smm.jl` carries out the Simulated Method of Moments procedure to assess the impact of firing-cost uncertainty
   - `sym_cal.jl` derives the analytical solutions of the differential equations stemming from the dual labor market dynamics
